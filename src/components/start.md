The Griffin Chart Builder is a no-code way to build digital-first charts using the [Highcharts charting library][1]. For more information and instructions, please see [the documentation (TK)][2].

The chart builder automatically provides images to use as static versions online and the code to make them interactive. You can also get print-ready SVGs based on the digital output.
